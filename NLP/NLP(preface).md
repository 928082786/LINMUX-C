and artificial intelligence (AI) concerned with processing natural languages
such as English or Mandarin. This processing generally involves
translating natural language into data (numbers) that a computer can use to
learn about the world. And this understanding of the world is sometimes used
to generate natural language text that reflects that understanding.</font>
